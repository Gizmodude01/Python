  -File: arraySummation- 
    Function: The script will prompt the user to enter a series of numbers that will then be added into the array. when the user is finished the array will be sumed together using a loop. which will then present the total to the user.
    Purpose: Demonstrates the use of loops & arrays in Python, while also demonstrating the ability to make a basic debug log.
    Improvements?: If this were developed for pratical application I would simply use the Sum() command in Python.

    Improvements?: None
